### Project Description
Mimic: Fake Language Gibberish Generator is a fun tool that creates nonsense text styled to mimic the sound and rhythm of different languages like Korean, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin, Thai, and French. It adapts the output length based on the input, keeping short inputs concise and longer inputs rich and natural-sounding.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People want to sound like they know another language without actually learning one. Sadly, most fake ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù ends up as bad pasta names, fake ‚ÄúKorean‚Äù looks like random keyboard mashing, and fake ‚ÄúArabic‚Äù is just ‚Äúal-al-al.‚Äù The world desperately needs believable nonsense.



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a generator that crafts beautifully meaningless gibberish, tailored to mimic the rhythm and flavor of real languages. It doesn‚Äôt translate‚Äîoh no, that would be useful‚Äîit just makes nonsense that feels authentic, perfect for fake movie subtitles, imaginary countries, or confusing your friends.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS, ES6+)
- Frameworks: None (pure client-side code)
- Google Fonts (Quicksand), Web Speech API (for text-to-speech)
- Any text editor (VS Code), modern web browser for testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

For Hardware:
- Works on any device with a modern web browser (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone)
- No special hardware required, but microphone/speakers improve the text-to-speech and game experience
